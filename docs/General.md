Content Creation:
- When making content for the survival server, please always put your datapack/mod on the test server first if possible.
- No need to do any extensive testing, it's just a first line of defence to make sure it doesn't kill all mobs or erase all player data when loaded.
- Also, if you put stuff on the survival server directly, you won't be able to copy directly from the test server to survival in the future. This means you (or more likely someone else) have to manually filter what to copy which increases the risk of bugs that only show up in production.
- I recommend creating a list of all things (such as datapacks, new mods or general world data) on the test server you have changed and want to copy to survival at some point in the future (you don't need to do this for METAmods or the default resource pack, since they will automatically upload to Survival when you merge your changes into the prod branch).
