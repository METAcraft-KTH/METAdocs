Datapacks:
- There is an upper limit on how many commands may be executed in a single game tick. This is especially important to consider when writing recursive functions. Please use the schedule function for recursive calls in functions which will be executed by an unknown number of players. If the number of affected objects is known, test it to ensure schedule can be safely omitted. Remember, other datapacks that may be running at the same time also add to the total count. You can of course increase the limit by changing the `max_command_forks` (or `maxCommandForkCount` on older versions) game rule, but this should ideally only be used as a last resort if bugs are discovered mid-tournament.
- By default, entity selectors select all entities in all loaded dimensions. Sometimes, you may want an entity selector to select all entities, but only within a specific dimension. You can accomplish this by setting the distance parameter to greater than or equal to 0, i.e. `@e[distance=0..]`, and using `/execute in` to choose the target dimension if necessary.
